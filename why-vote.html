                        <p><em>(Source:&nbsp;https://aactnow.org/why-vote/)</em><br>Because if you don't vote, you won't have a say in how our country is run. <strong>No Vote. No Voice.</strong></p>

                                <p><br>Increasing the number of people that vote in each election means better representation, more funding to our communities, and a better quality of life. Politicians listen to two things, money and votes. If we work together as a community and increase voter turnout, then our state and national legislators will listen to our needs. Education, healthcare, immigration, infrastructure, the economy, our veterans, etc. are all affected by our vote.<br><br>By working together to increase voter turnout, our community will benefit through job growth, better healthcare, better education, better infrastructure, a better economy, safer neighborhoods, and most importantly a better quality of life for our families. Its time to change the status quo and improve the lives of everyone we care about through voting, because&nbsp;<strong>our voice matters.</strong><br></p>

                        <h4><strong>Top 10 Reasons to Vote</strong><br></h4>
                        <p>Even if you went to a polling location and only voted for one person, it will be counted. By law your vote has to be counted. Your ballot cannot be skipped or ignored otherwise it is unconstitutional Sometimes elections can come down to a small number of votes which greatly affects how your city, state, and nation are run. Your vote counts, vote!<br></p>

                                <p><br><strong>1. Vote! It's Your Right.</strong><br>People have died defending this right. Don’t take it for granted! Voting is more than just electing a candidate, it’s choosing the right policies and people who have your best interests in mind when making decisions that will affect our community, state and nation. When you vote, you are taking an active role in deciding issues regarding health care, immigration, equal opportunity, voting rights, infrastructure, jobs, education, social security, neighborhood safety, taxes, etc.<br><br></p>

                                <p><br><strong>2. Vote to Allocate Federal Money To this Region.</strong><br>This money can be used for education, youth programs, healthcare, veterans, creating jobs, the environment, etc. In the Rio Grande Valley 4 out of 10 people vote in a Presidential Election and only 2 out of 10 vote in a Gubernatorial Election. This is not enough! For this region to grow and get state and federal funding, we need to vote.<br><br></p>

                                <p><br><strong>3. If You Do Not Vote, Someone Else Will.</strong><br>Voting only takes a couple of minutes but the ripple effect caused by your vote will last beyond a candidate’s term. Do you want someone else deciding for you the laws that will affect your family and community? Voting gives you the power to choose how your city, state, and country will be run. If you don’t vote, you can’t complain! Go vote and make the decision before someone else does it for you.<br></p>
